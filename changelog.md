## v1.2 — 2025-12-28
Revised to address concerns from physicist and quantum information theorist reviewers:

### Bell's Theorem Section
- Added technical precision about measurement independence and superdeterminism
- Clarified that Bell's theorem is about quantum correlations themselves, not just observer limitations
- Added note that CSR interpretation is one framing among several

### Quantum Information Theory Section (major expansion)
- Distinguished three categories of limits: structural (no-cloning), measurement (uncertainty), and resource (Bekenstein)
- Clarified that "information conservation" refers to quantum information under unitary evolution
- Added discussion of entanglement as both limit and resource
- Added connection to contextuality literature (Kochen-Specker)

### Constants Section
- Reframed as speculative philosophical interpretation
- Acknowledged this is not a physical derivation
- Added explicit status note marking it as philosophical reflection, not physics

### Singularities Section
- Distinguished between coordinate singularities (artifacts) and curvature singularities (physical)
- Acknowledged the "projection artifact" interpretation is speculative
- Added caveats about what string theory does and doesn't resolve

### Formalization Section
- Added connection to quantum contextuality and Kochen-Specker theorem
- Added quantum extension using density matrices and quantum information measures
- Connected to sheaf-theoretic language (Abramsky-Brandenburger)
- Added explicit scope note about which theorems the formalization captures

### String Theory Section
- Significantly moderated claims about CSR's diagnostic power
- Clarified that CSR reframes rather than explains
- Acknowledged that observations are post-hoc, not predictions

### Predictive Power Claims
- Replaced "predictive power" with "retrodictive coherence and heuristic anticipation"
- Added explicit note distinguishing retrodiction from prediction

### New Objection
- Added "What precisely is the 'common structural pattern'?" objection
- Provided explicit 5-step heuristic schema definition
- Acknowledged this is philosophical, not mathematical

### Information/Energy/Geometry Section
- Added technical precision about Bekenstein bound (entropy vs. information)
- Expanded holographic principle discussion with scope caveats
- Distinguished physical resource limits from structural and logical limits

### References
- Added contextuality references (Kochen-Specker, Spekkens, Budroni et al.)
- Added quantum information references (Holevo, Dieks, Barnum et al.)
- Added holographic error correction references (Almheiri et al., Penington)
- Added Landauer's principle reference

## v1.1 — 2025-12-15
- Added Fitch's Paradox aside + references
- Restored/verified full TOC jump links and section anchors
- Added schema.org metadata and accessibility tweaks
