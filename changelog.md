# Changelog

## v1.5 — 2026-01-10
Differentiation revisions: positioned CSR as operational framework distinct from narrative limit-accounts (Gleiser, Rescher, Floridi).

### New Section: "Prior Art and Positioning"
- Added after Definitions, before "A puzzle about progress"
- Acknowledges Gleiser *The Island of Knowledge* (2014), Rescher *The Limits of Science* (1999), Floridi *The Philosophy of Information* (2011)
- Explicitly states what CSR shares with these works vs. what CSR adds:
  - Unified constraint-template (not just catalog)
  - Research triage heuristics (operational, not existential)
  - Falsifiable structure (if limits are unrelated, CSR fails)

### Abstract Enhancement
- Added sentence emphasizing CSR provides "classification scheme and research-prioritization heuristics" vs. narrative accounts

### New Key Claim
- Added 6th claim: "Operational, not existential"—CSR's value is research triage, not philosophical meaning-making

### Pattern Section Enhancement
- Boxed the 4-step CSR template for visibility
- Added template instantiation table showing how Gödel, Turing, Bell, Bekenstein, and Goodhart each fill in the Ambition/Constraint/Conflict/Resolution slots
- Added note clarifying structural similarity vs. identity

### CSR Framework Section
- Added "What CSR Does Not Claim" note box preempting misreadings:
  - Does not discover new limits
  - Does not claim limits are identical
  - Does not compete on existential meaning
  - Does not predict specific theorems
  - Does not claim novelty in observing science has limits

### Implications Section Renamed
- Changed "Implications: how CSR reframes research priorities" → "Research triage: CSR as operational guide"
- Updated sidebar and main TOC

### Closing Section Enhancement
- Added differentiation paragraph contrasting CSR with Gleiser/Rescher/Floridi
- Emphasizes practical utility as test of CSR, not philosophical persuasion

### Navigation Updates
- Added "Prior Art" to sidebar and main TOC

## v1.4 — 2026-01-01
Added Appendix E: Cohomological Formalization—a rigorous mathematical framework for CSR's "common structural pattern" claim.

### Appendix E: New Sections
- **E.1 Contextuality Sheaves**: Reproduces Abramsky-Brandenburger (2011) construction showing Bell nonlocality as non-trivial Čech cohomology
- **E.2 The Gödel Sheaf**: Novel extension using topos-theoretic logic to formalize Gödelian incompleteness as obstruction to global section
- **E.3 Information-Theoretic Presheaves**: Original contribution constructing presheaves for Bekenstein-type entropy bounds; horizons as cohomological singularities
- **E.4 Structural Unification**: Analysis of shared properties across obstruction classes (H¹ degree, reflexivity pattern, logical form)

### Mathematical Prerequisites Box
- Added accessible introduction to presheaves, sheaves, and cohomology
- Explains obstruction classes as "measures of failure to glue"

### Unification Table
- Shows Bell, Gödel, and Bekenstein limits share: same cohomological degree, same generative mechanism (reflexivity), same logical pattern

### CSR-Consistent Conclusions
- Explicitly states what CAN be proven (structural similarity) vs. what CANNOT be proven per CSR's own constraints (common source identity)
- Frames obstruction pattern as "the strongest evidence embedded observers can obtain"

### New References Section: "Sheaf theory, contextuality, and topos logic"
- Abramsky & Brandenburger (2011) — foundational sheaf-theoretic contextuality
- Okay et al. (2017) — topological proofs of contextuality
- Lawvere (1969) — categorical diagonal arguments

- Awodey (2010) — category theory introduction
- Mac Lane & Moerdijk (1994) — sheaves in geometry and logic
- Yanofsky (2003) — universal approach to self-referential paradoxes

### Navigation Updates
- Added Appendix E to sidebar and inline TOC

## v1.3 — 2025-12-28
Added philosophical positioning to strengthen scholarly context:

### Expanded "Relationship to structural realism" section
- Added distinction between CSR and Ontic Structural Realism (Ladyman & Ross)
- Added contrast with Constructive Empiricism (van Fraassen): CSR's restraint is structurally enforced, not voluntary
- Added engagement with anti-fundamentalism (Cartwright): CSR explains why the world appears "dappled" while preserving realism

### New "Related philosophical positions" subsection
- **Morrison**: Models as mediators—direct support for CSR's compression/projection framework
- **Earman**: Singularities as theory limits—alignment with CSR's interpretation of boundaries
- **Friedman**: Conceptual frameworks—CSR constrains what any framework can claim
- **Maudlin**: Physics-literate metaphysics—methodological alignment

### New references section: "Philosophy of science: limits, models, and frameworks"
- van Fraassen (1980) *The Scientific Image*
- Cartwright (1983) *How the Laws of Physics Lie*
- Cartwright (1999) *The Dappled World*
- Earman (1989) *World Enough and Space-Time*
- Earman (1995) *Bangs, Crunches, Whimpers, and Shrieks*
- Morgan & Morrison (1999) *Models as Mediators*
- Friedman (2001) *Dynamics of Reason*
- Maudlin (2007) *The Metaphysics Within Physics*
- Morrison (2015) *Reconstructing Reality*
- Ladyman & Ross (2007) *Every Thing Must Go*

## v1.2 — 2025-12-28
Revised to address concerns from physicist and quantum information theorist reviewers:

### Bell's Theorem Section
- Added technical precision about measurement independence and superdeterminism
- Clarified that Bell's theorem is about quantum correlations themselves, not just observer limitations
- Added note that CSR interpretation is one framing among several

### Quantum Information Theory Section (major expansion)
- Distinguished three categories of limits: structural (no-cloning), measurement (uncertainty), and resource (Bekenstein)
- Clarified that "information conservation" refers to quantum information under unitary evolution
- Added discussion of entanglement as both limit and resource
- Added connection to contextuality literature (Kochen-Specker)

### Constants Section
- Reframed as speculative philosophical interpretation
- Acknowledged this is not a physical derivation
- Added explicit status note marking it as philosophical reflection, not physics

### Singularities Section
- Distinguished between coordinate singularities (artifacts) and curvature singularities (physical)
- Acknowledged the "projection artifact" interpretation is speculative
- Added caveats about what string theory does and doesn't resolve

### Formalization Section
- Added connection to quantum contextuality and Kochen-Specker theorem
- Added quantum extension using density matrices and quantum information measures
- Connected to sheaf-theoretic language (Abramsky-Brandenburger)
- Added explicit scope note about which theorems the formalization captures

### String Theory Section
- Significantly moderated claims about CSR's diagnostic power
- Clarified that CSR reframes rather than explains
- Acknowledged that observations are post-hoc, not predictions

### Predictive Power Claims
- Replaced "predictive power" with "retrodictive coherence and heuristic anticipation"
- Added explicit note distinguishing retrodiction from prediction

### New Objection
- Added "What precisely is the 'common structural pattern'?" objection
- Provided explicit 5-step heuristic schema definition
- Acknowledged this is philosophical, not mathematical

### Information/Energy/Geometry Section
- Added technical precision about Bekenstein bound (entropy vs. information)
- Expanded holographic principle discussion with scope caveats
- Distinguished physical resource limits from structural and logical limits

### References
- Added contextuality references (Kochen-Specker, Spekkens, Budroni et al.)
- Added quantum information references (Holevo, Dieks, Barnum et al.)
- Added holographic error correction references (Almheiri et al., Penington)
- Added Landauer's principle reference

## v1.1 — 2025-12-15
- Added Fitch's Paradox aside + references
- Restored/verified full TOC jump links and section anchors
- Added schema.org metadata and accessibility tweaks
