## Abstract

Across logic, mathematics, physics, information theory, and control, some of the most consequential modern results are not new mechanisms but *boundary theorems*: proof has limits (Gödel), prediction has limits (Turing), local descriptions have limits (Bell), and information extraction has limits (quantum information and gravitational bounds).

This essay argues that these are not unrelated accidents. They share a common structural source: **embedded observers operate through compressed representations, and compressed internal access cannot stably reconstruct global structure.**

Constrained Structural Realism (CSR) preserves realism about structure while explaining why access to that structure is necessarily partial. It reframes "progress" not as the march toward a complete internal description, but as the discovery of invariants and constraints that survive theory change.

## Key Concepts

*   **Embedded Observer:** An agent that is part of the system it studies; observation is a physical interaction, not a passive reading.
*   **Structural Coupling:** The dynamic history of interaction between observer and system that creates correlation without requiring total information transfer.
*   **Inference Limits:** Following Wolpert (2008), no physical inference device can fully predict the state of a system that contains it.
*   **Interface Failure:** Singularities and paradoxes are interpreted not as ontological features of the world, but as failures of the observer's compressed interface.
