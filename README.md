## Abstract

Across logic, mathematics, physics, information theory, and control, some of the most consequential modern results are not new mechanisms but *boundary theorems*: proof has limits (Gödel), prediction has limits (Turing), local descriptions have limits (Bell), and information extraction has limits (quantum information and gravitational bounds).

This essay argues that these are not unrelated accidents. They share a common structural source: **embedded observers operate through compressed representations, and compressed internal access cannot stably reconstruct global structure.**

Constrained Structural Realism (CSR) preserves realism about structure while explaining why access to that structure is necessarily partial. It reframes "progress" not as the march toward a complete internal description, but as the discovery of invariants and constraints that survive theory change.

## Key Concepts

*   **Embedded observer:** An agent that is part of the system it studies or controls; observation and intervention are causally entangled.
*   **Global structure:** The full state/organization of a system (e.g., a global quantum state, a complete phase space distribution, or an institution's full causal state).
*   **Local access:** The limited set of measurements, observables, or data streams available from within, often constrained by locality, resources, or horizons.
*   **Compression / projection:** Any mapping from a high-dimensional state to a lower-dimensional representation (a proxy metric, an observable set, a model class). Many-to-one mappings lose information.
*   **Proxy:** A compressed indicator used to stand in for a richer target state (in science, measurement; in control, a cost function; in institutions, a metric).
*   **Reflexivity:** The condition where the representation affects the system it represents (measurement backreaction, incentive feedback, model-mediated behavior).
*   **Boundary theorem / no-go result:** A principled limit showing that a class of hoped-for descriptions or procedures cannot exist under stated assumptions.
